# Getting Started with Create React App & Basic Form Design with an implementaion of useState hook

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Overview
```sh
npx create-react-app my-first-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

## Run my project:
- Open a terminal in directory where you want to save the project 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/WFT-Interns/tshering-react-first-app.git
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open http://localhost:3000 to view my app in browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Creating an App

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```
